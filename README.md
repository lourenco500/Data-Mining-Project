# Data-Mining-Project
In this project, we acted as consultants for AIAI. Our task was to analyze customer loyalty membership data
and corresponding flight activity collected over a three-year period. Using these insights, we
developed a **data-driven segmentation strategy**.
The segmentation was approached from multiple perspectives, such as:
- Value-based segmentation, grouping customers according to their economic contribution.
- Behavioral segmentation, analyzing purchasing habits and travel behaviors.
- Demographic segmentation, categorizing customers by age, occupation, or other attributes to reveal
different interaction patterns.

The ultimate objective was to integrate these perspectives into a final segmentation framework that supports
AIAI in crafting a comprehensive marketing strategy.
